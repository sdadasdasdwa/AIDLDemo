# AIDLDemo
It's used to show a example of AIDL transaction between client and sever for iner-process communication. As we know, AIDL is based on the Binder technology, and this demo also used the big file transaction way by ParcalFIleDescriptor. In this project, I want to accomplish it by Java and Kotlin language.
